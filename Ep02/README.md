## 1. What is NPM?
NPM (Node Package Manager) is a tool used to **install, manage, and run JavaScript packages**.

**Why used?**
- Manages project dependencies
- Runs project scripts
- Shares reusable packages

---

## 2. What is Parcel / Webpack? Why do we need it?
Parcel and Webpack are **JavaScript bundlers**.

**What they do:**
- Bundle JS, CSS, and assets
- Resolve imports and dependencies
- Optimize code for production

**Why needed?**
- Browsers cannot understand modular project structures directly.

---

## 3. What is `.parcel-cache`?
`.parcel-cache` is a folder created by Parcel to store **cached build data**.

**Key points:**
- Improves rebuild speed
- Auto-generated
- Safe to delete
- Should not be pushed to Git

---

## 4. What is `npx`?
`npx` is a tool used to **run npm packages without installing them globally**.

**Why used?**
- Avoids global installations
- Runs CLI tools temporarily

---

## 5. Difference between `dependencies` and `devDependencies`

**dependencies:**  
Packages required in production.  
Example: React, Axios

**devDependencies:**  
Packages required only during development.  
Example: Parcel, Webpack, ESLint

---

## 6. What is Tree Shaking?
Tree Shaking is a **bundler optimization technique**.

**What it does:**
- Removes unused code
- Reduces bundle size
- Works with ES modules

---

## 7. What is Hot Module Replacement (HMR)?
HMR updates parts of the application **without reloading the entire page**.

**Why used?**
- Faster development
- Preserves application state
- Instant UI updates

---

## 8. Favorite 5 Superpowers of Parcel

**Five superpowers:**
- Zero configuration
- Built-in HMR
- Fast builds using caching
- Automatic code splitting
- Asset handling

**Describe any 3:**
- **Zero Config:** Works out of the box without setup.
- **Fast Builds:** Rebuilds only changed files.
- **HMR:** Updates UI instantly without refresh.

---

## 9. What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add?
`.gitignore` tells Git which files should **not be tracked**.

**Add to `.gitignore`:**
- `node_modules/`
- `dist/`
- `.parcel-cache/`
- `.env`

**Do NOT add:**
- Source code
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`

---

## 10. Difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

**package.json:**  
Defines dependencies and scripts.  
Allows version ranges.

**package-lock.json:**  
Locks exact dependency versions.  
Ensures same installs across all systems.

---

## 11. Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
- It is auto-generated by npm
- Manual changes can break dependency resolution
- Should only change via npm commands

---

## 12. What is `node_modules`? Is it a good idea to push that on Git?
`node_modules` contains all installed project dependencies.

**Key points:**
- Very large
- Auto-generated
- ❌ Should NOT be pushed to Git
- Can be recreated using `npm install`

---

## 13. What is the `dist` folder?
The `dist` folder contains **production-ready bundled files**.

**Key points:**
- Generated by bundlers
- Used for deployment
- Should not be committed to Git

---

## 14. What is `browserslist`?
`browserslist` defines which browsers your project supports.

**Why used?**
- Helps bundlers and transpilers
- Ensures browser compatibility

---

## 15. Different Bundlers: Vite, Webpack, Parcel

**Vite:**  
Very fast dev server using ES modules.

**Webpack:**  
Highly configurable and industry standard.

**Parcel:**  
Zero-config and beginner-friendly.

---

## 16. What are `^` (caret) and `~` (tilde)?

**Caret (`^`):**  
Allows minor and patch updates.

**Tilde (`~`):**  
Allows only patch updates.

---

## 17. Script Types in HTML (MDN Docs)

**`text/javascript`:**  
Default script type.

**`module`:**  
Supports ES modules (`import` / `export`).  
Deferred by default.

**`async`:**  
Loads and executes immediately.  
Order not guaranteed.

**`defer`:**  
Loads in background.  
Executes after HTML parsing.
